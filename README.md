## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before setting up Web Vulnerability Assessment Tool:

- Python 3.8 or newer.
- Redis server (for Celery task queue).
- PostgreSQL database. in
- A Linux-based operating system.
- Wapiti web vulnerability scanner. Install it using the following command:

```

## Setting Up

1. **Clone the repository**:
    
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nafdev01/web_assessment.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
    
```bash
cd web_assessment
```

3. **Create a virtual environment**:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

5. **Install the dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. **Database setup**:
 - Install the database server

```bash
sudo apt-get install postgresql
```
- Access the database server

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
``` 

 - Create a database and user
```bash
CREATE USER web_assessment_user WITH PASSWORD 'password';
```
 - Create a database with the owner as the user created

```bash
CREATE DATABASE web_assessment owner web_assessment_user;
```
- Set up the database and user for compatibility with the application by running the following commands:
```bash
ALTER ROLE web_assessment_user SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
ALTER ROLE web_assessment_user SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
ALTER ROLE web_assessment_user SET timezone TO 'UTC';
```

7. **Set up the environment variables**:
- Use the .env.example file to create a .env file in the root directory. Update the environment variables as needed.

8. **Run the migrations**:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

9. **Create a superuser account for the Django admin panel**

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

10. **Start the Django development server**:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

11. **Start the redis server**:
 - Open a new terminal and run the following command to start the Redis server.
 ```bash
redis-server
```
 - Alternatively you could start the redis service by running the following command:

 ```bash
sudo service redis-server start
```

12. **Start the celery worker**:
 - Open a new terminal and activate the virtual environment then run the following command:

```bash
celery -A django_project worker -l info
```

Your Web Vulnerability Assessment Tool instance should now be running on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Usage
 - Signup and login to the application in order to use the application. Once logged in click on the `Assess` button in the top right corner and enter the complete link of the url you want to assess. The scan will be initialized and once complete, a summary of the results will be sent to your email with a link to the site where you can get more detailed results and download a pdf report of the scan.
 - Please note that the scan may take up to 15-20 minutes to complete depending on the size of the site being scanned and the scope of vulnerbilites found.

## Troubleshooting

Include common issues and their solutions. Example:

- **Celery Worker Not Starting**: Ensure Redis is running and that you are in the virtual environment where Web Vulnerability Assessment Tool dependencies are installed.
 - **Database Connection Error**: Check that the database server is running and that the database credentials in the .env file are correct.
 - **Wapiti Not Installed**: Install Wapiti using the command provided in the prerequisites section.
 - **Vulnerability Scan Not Starting**: Ensure the URL provided is correct and that the scan has been initialized successfully.
